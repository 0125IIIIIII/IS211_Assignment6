This exercise consists of separate modules for Stub vs Real Implementations tests, allowing each test to run independently, one for failing stubs and one for working code, without mixing logic or test results. Conversions files hold functions that do temperature unit conversions; and tests hold functions for all tests.

conversions_stub.py — Exercise part I
conversions.py — Exercise parts II to IV
conversions_refactored.py — Exercise part V
tests_stub.py — Exercise part I tests (run is expected to fail)
tests.py — Exercise parts II to V tests (runs are expected to pass)
