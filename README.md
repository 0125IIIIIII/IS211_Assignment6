This exercise consists of separate modules for Stub vs Real Implementations tests, allowing each test run independently, one for failing stubs, one for working code, without mixing logic or test results.
Conversions holds functions that do temperature unit conversions; and tests hold all tests.
1. conversions_stub.py — Part I 
2. conversions.py — Parts II to IV
3. conversions_refactored.py — Part V
4. tests_stub.py — Part I tests (run is expected to fail)
5. tests.py — Parts II to V (runs are expected to pass)
